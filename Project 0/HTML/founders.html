                    to speak with snakes) and skilled at Legilimency. Slytherin didn't trust Muggle-born students. Salazar Slytherin was known to possess great cunning and determination, qualities he prized. Slytherin is said to be one of the greatest
                    wizards of his age, with extensive abilities, particularly in Legilimency. When considering Sorting a student into Slytherin, the Sorting Hat looks for Slytherin's traits in the student, including cunning, determination, and resourcefulness.
                    He mistrusted Muggle-born students to the point of proposing that they should not be accepted at Hogwarts. However, when he expressed his opinion to the other Hogwarts founders, they did not agree with him. In response, he left the
                    school, never to return.

                <p style="color: navajowhite;"> <img src="../IMAGES/grifindor.gif" alt="Godric Grifindor" style="width: 20%; float: left; padding-right: 20px;"> Godric was known for his bravery, and his skills as an accomplished dueller. He even had a special sword created for him by
                    Ragnuk the First, the finest of the goblin silversmiths. The sword was ‘gleaming silver’ with ‘rubies the size of eggs’. The sword was so beautiful that Ragnuk tried to take it back, accusing Godric of stealing it. Thankfully, Godric
                    was not one to be trifled with, and eventually took back what was his from the goblin community. This didn’t stop the goblins creating a ‘fake myth’ of Gryffindor theft, however. Legend has it that Godric was also the man who gave
                    Hogwarts the Sorting Hat, a sentient piece of headwear that soon became the one to sort the school’s students into houses long after Godric and the other founders were gone. The hat contains the intelligence of all founders, so it
                    can pass on their intuition on each Hogwarts student forever. Godric will always be known for his accomplished skills in battle, and his fight against Muggle discrimination in the wizarding world. In fact, it was a serious argument
                    between Godric and Salazar that finally made the Slytherin founder leave Hogwarts. Godric was a man, certainly, ahead of his time.

                    families they came from. At Hogwarts, Hufflepuff was known for her talents in Charms, and used her remarkable skills for preparing food – a speciality of hers – to create splendid feasts that were enjoyed by all. Her talent would bring
                    the whole school together in harmony. Helga Hufflepuff’s fantastic recipes are still used in the Hogwarts kitchens to this day and her portrait can be found in the Hufflepuff common room, toasting her students with her golden cup.
                    No wonder the Hogwarts feasts are always so triumphant and bountiful.

                <p style="color: navajowhite;"><img src="../IMAGES/ravenclaw.gif" alt="Rowena Ravenclaw" style="width: 20%; float: left; padding-right: 20px;"> Rowena Ravenclaw, ‘from glen’, was the most brilliant witch of her time, but her story is one of tragedy. Known for her wit
                    and love of learning, she wore a diadem that was said to grant wisdom to the wearer. However, Rowena’s own daughter grew jealous of her mother’s incredible intelligence. Helena Ravenclaw stole her mother’s diadem and ran away, a fact
                    that Rowena kept hidden from her fellow founders even when she fell ill. Desperate to see her daughter one last time, Rowena sent a man to bring Helena home. Unfortunately, that man was the Bloody Baron, who was head over heels with
                    Helena, and stabbed her in a rage when she refused to come home. After Helena was tragically killed, legend tells us that Rowena Ravenclaw died of a broken heart. No wonder Helena’s ghost, that became Ravenclaw’s house ghost, would
                    often roam the corridors in silence.
