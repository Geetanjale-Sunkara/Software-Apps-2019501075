My website is based on Hogwarts which is one of my favorite fictional topics. Hogwart is a school for witchcraft and wizardry. 
My website has a total of 5 pages including home, my website contains ordered and unordered lists, table and images. As per the requirements, I have also used different CSS properties, mobile-responsive media query for setting the backgrounds, used Bootstrap 4 for the navigation bar and grid model, SCSS variable SCSS nesting and SCSS inheritance.
