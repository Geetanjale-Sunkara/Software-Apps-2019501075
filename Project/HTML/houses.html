                    and silver. Its founder is Salazar Slytherin, and their element is water. The Slytherin ghost is the Bloody Baron. Slytherins are known to be ambitious, yearning for power, and tend to be pure bloods. They are seen as “the worst house”
                    and produces the most dark wizards and witches. They are portrayed as the least liked of all the four houses. However, not every Slytherin turns out dark, perhaps signifying that the concepts of good and evil are not at all straightforward,
                    seen especially in Professor Snape. This might be used to show that even people sorted into a house like Slytherin- or in other similar real life situations- may not all be “bad”. Few greatest wizards of Slytherin are:

                    which shows this very clearly. Its founder is Godric Gryffindor. Its element is that of fire, and its ghost is Nearly Headless Nick. Students who belong in Gryffindor are normally very bold and chivalrous, but can be reckless or arrogant.
                    they are seen as the main house, into which almost every main character is Sorted, possibly to expand on their rivalry against Slytherin house. It could also signify the importance of bravery within times of war, and the strength of
                    chivalrous loyalty to one another, which Gryffindors tend to possess.

                    others, and are seen as people who do not fit into the other three houses, or are seen as “weak” or “untalented”. Hufflepuff might have been used as a way of seeing how other misfits are unjustly seen within society, and may be saying
                    that these supposed “oddballs” have deeper depths and have their own interests, skill sets, and talents.

                    be seen as “weird” and are sometimes extremely competitive when it comes to exams. Ravenclaw’s ghost, The Grey Lady, is notable in helping Harry in finding the Ravenclaw diadem, and her story may reflect themes of power, betrayal,
                    envy, and pride.
